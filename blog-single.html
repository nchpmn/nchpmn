                    <p>Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!</p>

                    <p>Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Why not indeed! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.</li>
                    <li>Goodbye, friends.  I never thought I'd die like this.  But I always really hoped.</li>
                    <li>Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." </li>

                    <h3>Leela's Homeworld</h3>
                    <p>What are their names? Oh, I don't have time for this.  I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Kids have names? Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. It's a T. It goes "tuh".</p>
                    <h4>Amazon Women in the Mood</h4>
                    <p>Kif might! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</li>
                    <li>You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?</li>
                    <li>That's not soon enough!</li>
                    <li>Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>The Deep South</h3>
                    <p>There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates&hellip; PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Why would I want to know that? You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?</p>
                    <h4>How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back</h4>
                    <p>Goodbye, friends.  I never thought I'd die like this.  But I always really hoped. Can we have Bender Burgers again? For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".</p>
                    <h5>A Big Piece of Garbage</h5>
                    <p>Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Tell them I hate them.</p>
                    <h5>Where No Fan Has Gone Before</h5>
                    <p>Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Goodbye, friends.  I never thought I'd die like this.  But I always really hoped. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</p>
                    <h6>Rebirth</h6>
                    <p>Leela's gonna kill me. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!</p>

                    <p>I can explain. It's very valuable. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. They're like sex, except I'm having them!</p>
                    <p>Is the Space Pope reptilian!? No! The cat shelter's on to me. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Then we'll go with that data file!</p>
