Title: Test Vimeo

Text: Thanks very much for this, very helpful. I think there is one very small typo. You use # in the id_img variables, but haven't got the # in the img element id. Does your example assume the use of jQuery as well? I swopped the $(id_img).before and $(id_img).attr for createElement and a more basic getElementById(id_img).src, but wouldn't have got it at all if it wasn't for your example. â€“  atomicules Mar 13 '11 at 22:52
