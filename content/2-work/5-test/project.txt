To coincide with the single release, the website 24hoursofhappy.com was launched, featuring a visual presentation of "Happy", advertised as being "the world's first 24-hour music video." The video was shot by steadicam operator Jon Beattie, and its creative director was Yoann Lemoine. It consists of the four-minute song repeated multiple times, with various people dancing around Los Angeles and miming along. The website allows users to navigate to various points in the 24-hour timeframe, including all 360 four-minute segments.

Pharrel Williams himself appears 24 times in the day-long video, once at the start of each hour. There are a number of celebrity cameos in the video, including Whit Hertford, Kelly Osbourne, Magic Johnson, Urijah Faber, SÃ©rgio Mendes, Jimmy Kimmel, Odd Future, Steve Carell (who plays Gru in Despicable Me 2), Jamie Foxx, Ana Ortiz, Miranda Cosgrove (who plays Margo in Despicable Me 2), Gavin DeGraw and JoJo. The minions from Despicable Me 2 make several appearances throughout the film, including one scene at 3:00 am, in which Pharrell Williams and the minions dance in a movie theatre that is playing the scene from Despicable Me 2 in which "Happy" appears. A lone, one-eyed minion also appears dancing to song in its entirety at 4:40 pm.

An official four-minute edit of the video was also released onto YouTube on 21 November 2013, and has had over 515 million views, making it the 27th most viewed YouTube video of all time. It was nominated for Best Male Video and Video of the Year at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. The 24-hour music video for "Happy" was also projected at the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema in April 2014.
