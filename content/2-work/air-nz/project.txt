This is better! Alright, this was a fun one. Flown over to New Zealand, and, well... just look at it.

Turning a mountain into a Christmas tree, what could go wrong? Come behind the scenes on the making of A Very Kiwi Christmas.

Air New Zealand Limited (NZX: AIR, ASX: AIZ) is the national airline and flag carrier of New Zealand. Based in Auckland, the airline operates scheduled passenger flights to 25 domestic and 26 international destinations in 15 countries across Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania.[8] The airline has been a member of the Star Alliance since 1999.[8]

Air New Zealand originated in 1940 as Tasman Empire Airways Limited (TEAL), a flying boat company operating trans-Tasman flights between New Zealand and Australia. TEAL became wholly owned by the New Zealand government in 1965, whereupon it was renamed Air New Zealand. The airline mainly served international routes until 1978, when the government merged it and the domestic-orientated New Zealand National Airways Corporation (NAC) into a single airline under the Air New Zealand name. Air New Zealand was largely privatised in 1989, but returned to majority government ownership in 2001 after a failed tie up with Australian carrier Ansett Australia (when Ansett suffered financial issues and folded operations during that year). As of 2008, Air New Zealand carries 11.7 million passengers annually.[8]

Air New Zealand's route network focuses on Australasia and the South Pacific, with long-haul services to East Asia, North America and the United Kingdom. It was the last airline to circumnavigate the world because of its flagship NZ1/2 (Heathrow – Los Angeles – Auckland) and NZ39/38 (Auckland – Hong Kong – Heathrow) flights, the latter of which ended in March 2013 when Air New Zealand stopped Hong Kong – London flights, in favour of a code sharing deal with Cathay Pacific.[9][10] The airline's main hub is Auckland Airport, located near Mangere in the southern part of the Auckland urban area.[11] Air New Zealand is headquartered in a building called "The Hub", located 20 km (12 mi) away from Auckland Airport, in the Western Reclamation, in central Auckland.[12]

Air New Zealand currently operates an international long-haul fleet consisting of mainly the Boeing 777 variant family, with Boeing 767-300 and Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft supplementing them. Airbus A320 aircraft operate on short-haul international routes (i.e. to Australia and the Pacific Islands), and on domestic routes alongside Boeing 737-300 airliners. Air New Zealand's regional subsidiaries, Air Nelson, Eagle Airways, and Mount Cook Airline, operate additional short-haul New Zealand domestic services using turboprop aircraft. Air New Zealand was awarded Airline of the Year in 2010[13] and 2012[14] by the Air Transport World Global Airline Awards.
