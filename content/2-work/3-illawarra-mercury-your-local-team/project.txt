Title: Illawarra Mercury: Your Local Team

----

Text: 

This targeted television commercial campaign was produced to highlight how the local newspaper, the Illawarra Mercury, was produced in the region in a time where consolidating editors and reporters is becoming increasingly common.

As we were shooting in a working newsroom, it would be impossible to stage our setups, as we were required to shoot as fly-on-the-wall. Shooting with the RED Scarlet-X with Canon CN-E Primes enabled us to achieve the cinematic style within the constraints of an active, working environment.
