This behind-the-scenes look at the TVC campaign created for Nikolovski Lawyers really gives a great overview of how the process works at Relativity: how a brand is reconstructed into the emotional hooks, and then translated into film.

My role on this production was as the Camera Assistant and Gimbal Operator. Using the DJI Ronin along with a wireless transmitter - in this case, the Paralinx Arrow - made for a simple production, with instant feedback from the Director, more akin to using a traditional camera.
