The overall marketing campaign for Nikolovski Lawyers consisted of three Television Commercials ([Morning Run][1], [The Fighter][2], and [Family Building][3]) as well as bus and newspaper advertising, and increased community sponsorship. This behind-the-scenes look at the TVC campaign created for Nikolovski Lawyers really gives a great overview of how the process works at Relativity: how a brand is reconstructed into the emotional hooks, and then translated into film, both for television and cinema advertising.

Each commercial was shot back-to-back in a 5 day window. As Camera Assistant, prep and deprep for the camera packages during this time was essential, as there was no downtime in our schedule. We shot on the RED EPIC-X camera, along with Canon CN-E Prime Lenses[^1].

With the fast pace of production, and the use of a DJI Ronin, we opted for wireless video tramsmission for the Director's Monitor - in this case, the Paralinx Arrow. Whilst that entry-level product was not without its issues (a story for another time), it proved an essential part of our camera kits. With such a compressed schedule combined with the high cinematography standard we required, a wireless monitor freed the Director from Video Village, letting him work from anywhere on set.
