Excerpt: With the new site finally up (and with some luck, working!), it's about time to take a stroll back through the development of this site. It all began back in 2011...

Before I was *Nathan Chapman*, I was Chapman Films. My site was hosted on Tumblr, using a theme I'd found called [hasaportfolio](http://hasaportfolio.com/). It looked something like this:

Whilst that's only the theme, and not the actual content of the site, this was me. My portfolio[^1]. Running on Tumblr was a choice I'd originally made to avoid having to look around for hosting and the like. It was also a simple backend, that already had great support for media (so long as you weren't using Tumblr's video hosting). What made Tumblr special (or especially frustrating) was the Twig templating engine. Twig makes extensive use of curly brackets for everything from calling content to logic loops. For example:

    {% extends "layout.html" %}
    
    {% block content %}
        Content of the page...
    {% endblock %}

Blergh! To open or close a single tag, you needed to type both a <code>{</code> and a <code>%</code>. 

From that, we took the great leap to a self-hosted, completely owned website. My first stop was WordPress, however, alas, I've no trace of that 'generation' of website. Next up, in 2012, was a site built in Stacey, a flat-file CMS.

Except on the website front:

Over the course of around 9 or 12 months, this static html design didn't progress much. I don't remember what my intentions where for using it, whether it would be run on Stacey, or WordPress, or another beast entirely.

2014 saw a proper foray into the world of WordPress, with the use of a blog theme called [Brooklyn](http://themeforest.net/item/brooklyn-creative-one-page-multipurpose-theme/6221179?ref=nchpmn). I can best describe this template as being a bloated monster, having to be fought with shortcodes and sub-pages and custom menus that defined what pages were pulled onto the home page. In short, WordPress isn't build for this sort of customisation, and having to
