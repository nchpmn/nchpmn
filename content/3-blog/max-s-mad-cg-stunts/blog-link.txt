Quote: 

Iloura applied that real world behavior to digi-doubles of the War Boys in rag-doll sim software Endorphin. But when Miller saw the result he felt it no longer looked right for the scene.

“The reason is,” suggests Wood, “that there’s a real difference between what we know as real world actions and movie actions. We’re so used to seeing what stuntmen do in these kinds of crashes. They will take a run and jump off a bounce board and fly through the air and circle their arms and pedal their legs - it’s an exaggerated performance and totally part of film language.”

There's some terrific practical stunt work in *Mad Max: Fury Road*, but somewhat more impressive is the integration between the computer-generated stunt work and the practical, live action, blood and bone stunting.

The mere fact this decision was made is indicative of a deep understanding of what makes a film work, and what makes a film seem real to an audience. After all, only if it feels real does a film emotionally resonate with the audience. Note here that a film doesn't have to *be* real - only seem real.
