Title: Up The Mountain

Excerpt: You're on location, up a mountain, in the middle of a sub-tropical rainforest, when it happens. It doesn't matter what went wrong, you need to keep shooting. It doesn't matter how big your production is, that's it: they're all waiting on you. The next two minutes are important - but crucial are the days spent before the shoot...

I spent the last weekend in exactly this position: halfway up a mountain, in the rain and mud, chasing after a weekend boot camp race. Whilst I certainly feel fitter[^1] than I have in some time, the weekend proved just as punishing to the equipment I had with me.

I was shooting with the [DJI Ronin][ronin], flying a [Sony A7s][a7s] with the [Metabones Adapter Mk. IV][metabones] and the [Canon 17-40mm f4 L-series][lens]. The nice thing about this  camera setup is that both the camera body and the lens are weatherproof. Although that's not a specific certification, it does mean they can without some amount of rain and water ingress.

The Ronin, on the other hand, is a bit more difficult. The main point of a three-axis gimbal, like the Ronin, is to remove angular camera movement from the image. What this means is that unwanted panning, tilting and roll - the elements that actually contribute the most to 'handheld' camera movement - are isolated from camera translation. The camera can move freely through space, while suffering little angular movment.

As another tool on our belts, with its own unique set of specialities, the Ronin is the perfect tool for this job. It provided the ability to create some tremendous crane and dolly movments that would have been all but impossible with the run-and-gun setups required for such an event - let alone setting up a full crane in 2-inch mud.

Shooting in a rainforest, in Autumn, in the middle of a once-in-a-lifetime storm[^2], the Ronin's exposed electronics and brushless motors are the weakest point of the setup. If something's going to get damaged, it's going to be them. The obvious move is to waterproof them, but the motors and electronics require unrestricted movement.

This is where preparation becomes essential. Over two days, I researched and trialled different methods of waterproofing the motors. This was a labourious process, and it required getting into every part of the gimbal, even going so far as to remove the stage from the arms of the gimbal to wrap some plastic tubing over the sensors, which are positioned under the stage (whilst still leaving the camera mounting of the stage accessible).

The biggest drawback from the final waterproofed rig was the new difficulty in viewing the camera monitor. With the Ronin's design, the camera's monitor can easily be seen through the lattice framework of the rig. The Sony's articulating screen also works wonders in awkward situations, such a briefcase mode. However with the waterproofing covering the lattice, there are many fewer angles to see the viewfinder from - which could, if you haven't prepared and know your rig - have a severe affect on the accuracy of your framing. There was a small lack of precicion I normally like from my shots, however it worked for the tough, run-and-gun style we were shooting in.

The only time we had to stop shooting was when I suffered a mightly wound - a leech had jumped on.

Shooting without a crew means shooting without backup. Shooting solo, up a mountain, in the rain is just asking for trouble. Taking the time to properly investigate and prepare the camera payed off, as we were able to produce some incredible videos, even with the weather beating down on us.

Watch the final videos made for the [Bravo Team Challenge][bravo].
