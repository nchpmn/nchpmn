                <p class="lead text-left">I’m a specialist Steadicam Operator, and a talented Camera Assistant. When I’m not on set, I’m a Video&nbsp;Editor.</p>
                <p class="text-left">I’ve been working in both Film &amp; Television and Live Events for over four years, starting as an indispensable Production Assistant, before becoming enthralled with the camera department.</p>
                <p class="text-left">I’ve got a bunch of <a href="#quals">formal qualifications</a>, but being on set is so much more important. That’s why there's a kick-arse portfolio just <a href="#work">down there</a>.</p>
